      <description>A lot more Wise words.&#xA;You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.

Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Hey, you know how I&amp;rsquo;m, like, always trying to save the planet? Here&amp;rsquo;s my chance.&#xA;Must go faster&amp;hellip; go, go, go, go, go! You really think you can fly that thing?</description>
